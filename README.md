> **Collaboration Path:**

>  We start with an idea, e.g. real estate bubble detection. 
>  If we find it relevant for the mankind, we start coding.

> From your side :
> - You can either come up with a nice idea to investigate
> - Help to implement an on-going research direction
> - Theoretically contribute to our knowledge base in the next areas:
>> 1. Trading
>> 2. macro-economics 
>> 3. AI 
>> 4. Multi-agent modeling and emergent behavior

<i class="icon-file"></i> **Direction:** Remittance Game - find currency exchange strategy for expats.

Synopsis: There are more than 50 mln expats worldwide these days. But almost everyone asks the next questions:

 - My pension fond is in a country where I don't live anymore - is it risky?
 - I still have some savings at home. Should I transfer all now if I am not planning to return to my homeland?

How to answer on these questions without losing your money... in the world of Brexit, modern central banks' QE policies .... we will know soon...
