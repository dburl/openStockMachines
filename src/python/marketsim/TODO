1) SellOrder is equivalent to short -> it means that account balance can be negative upon sufficient reservation in base currency
    - transaction fees are still dedicted- check how
2) Observatio class should be returned from MarketModel to Agent and used in strategy:
    - it should include real market price
    - fees information (defined by market model)
3) order execution might not happen with the observed price due to slippage
    - so order execution should take into account MarketModel
4) graph visualization - it will help for debugging too
